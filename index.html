                    <p>football is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players each, who primarily use their
                        feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch. The objective of the game is to
                        score more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a
                        rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing team. Traditionally, the game has been played
                        over two 45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million
                        players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport. </p>
